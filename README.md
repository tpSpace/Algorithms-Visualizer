# Algorithms-Visualizer
This is a project made for the Data Structures and Algorithms course in International University with main the purpose of visualizing some algorithms. The project is finished with our initial intentions completed.

## Pre-requisites
This project is made with:
+ Pure HTML and CSS
+ TypeScript

## How to run
In order to run the project you need to
download TypeScript. When you have Node.js installed, you can use npm to install TypeScript globally:
+ Install Typescript
```bash
npm install -g typescript 
```
+ Run cmd
```bash 
tsc --watch
``` 
*Note*: It will auto compile from TypeScript into JavaScript everytime you save the files.

If you can't run the project, you can visit here: <https://tpspace.github.io/Algorithms-Visualizer/> to see the demo.

## Features
### Sorting Algorithms
+ Visualize the sorting process of algorithms via *Books* in a Library. The goal is to sort all the books alphabetically.
+ User can choose the Algorithm desired to visualize, the speed of the visualization, the number of books and the worst case.
+ **Algorithms supported**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort
### Path Finding Algorithms
+ Visualize the path finding process of algorithms via drawable *Maze*.
+ User is presented with a blank canvas in which the user can draw the maze, set the start and end point and visualize the path finding process.
+ User can choose the Algorithm desired to visualize, the speed of the visualization.
+ **Algorithms supported**: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search
